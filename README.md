# EyeStateClassification
The objective of Eye State Classification using EEG (electroencephalogram) dataset is to accurately classify the state of the eyes as either open or closed based on the signals recorded from the brain.

EEG signals are used to measure electrical activity in the brain, which can provide insights into the state of consciousness and cognitive function. By analyzing EEG data related to eye state, it is possible to develop algorithms that can accurately classify whether a person's eyes are open or closed, which can be useful in various applications such as monitoring driver fatigue, diagnosing sleep disorders, and developing brain-computer interfaces.

The primary goal is to develop a reliable and accurate classification algorithm that can perform well on EEG data and generalize to new subjects and situations.
